/// one at a time (apply to state, drop, advance cursor).

///
/// Implementations **must** yield events with monotonically increasing
/// versions. That is, for consecutive calls to `next()` that return
/// `Some(Ok(envelope))`, each envelope's `version()` must be strictly
/// greater than the previous one's. Violating this invariant will cause
/// incorrect aggregate rehydration (events applied out of order).
