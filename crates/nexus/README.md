**The foundational Rust crate for building uncompromising, type-safe, high-performance systems using DDD, ES, and CQRS.**

---

## Overview

Nexus provides the core building blocks and architectural guidance for developing sophisticated applications in Rust, strictly adhering to the principles of:

* **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** Encouraging rich domain models and clear boundaries.
* **Event Sourcing (ES):** Persisting state as a sequence of immutable domain events.
* **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** Separating write-side command processing from read-side queries.
* **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters):** Decoupling the application core from infrastructure concerns.
* **Clean Code:** Promoting testable, maintainable, and understandable code.

Nexus aims to be the gold standard for implementing these patterns idiomatically in Rust, leveraging the language's strengths ‚Äì particularly its powerful type system and concurrency primitives ‚Äì to their absolute limit.

## Core Philosophy & Goals

Nexus is being built with an uncompromising focus on:

* üöÄ **Performance & Efficiency:** Aiming for near-zero overhead abstractions, efficient dispatch, and minimal allocations. Performance is paramount.
* üîí **Extreme Type Safety:** Leveraging Rust's type system (traits, generics, associated types, lifetimes) to maximize compile-time correctness and eliminate runtime errors. Invalid states should be unrepresentable where possible.
* üèõÔ∏è **Architectural Purity & Power:** Strictly enforcing DDD, ES, CQRS, and Hexagonal principles. Utilizing advanced Rust features to achieve the objectively superior technical solution.
* ‚ú® **Ergonomic Public API (Future Goal):** While potentially complex internally, the crate's public API aims to be intuitive and require minimal boilerplate for users implementing the target architectures.
* ÌäºÌäº **Production-Grade Robustness:** Designed for thread-safety, rigorous testability (especially isolating domain logic), and the demands of high-throughput systems.
* üóº **`tower` Integration (Planned):** Intends to leverage the `tower` ecosystem (`Service`, `Layer`) for composable, high-performance middleware and service abstraction around command/query handlers.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Status (April 2025) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Nexus is currently in the early design and active development phase. It is NOT yet ready for production use.**

* **Focus:** Defining and solidifying the core abstractions for commands, events, aggregate state management (`AggregateState`, `AggregateType`, `AggregateRoot`), and command handling logic (`AggregateCommandHandler`). The design emphasizes type safety and testability, incorporating decisions like manual async handling (via `Pin<Box<dyn Future>>`) for explicit control.
* **Next Steps:** Finalizing core aggregate tests, defining the `EventSourcedRepository` port, designing the command/query dispatcher mechanism, implementing infrastructure adapters, and developing the query side.
* **Contributions:** Welcome! See the Contributing section.

## Core Concepts (Design In Progress)

* **Messages:** `Command`, `Query`, `DomainEvent` traits define the core message types, using associated types (`Result`, `Error`) for strong contracts.
* **Aggregate:** Decomposed into:
    * `AggregateState`: Holds state data, evolves via `apply(event)`.
    * `AggregateType`: Compile-time marker linking `Id`, `State`, `Event` types.
    * `AggregateRoot<AT>`: Manages state instance, version, uncommitted events; orchestrates command execution via `execute`.
* **Command Handling:**
    * `AggregateCommandHandler<C, Services> { type State; ... }`: Trait encapsulating pure domain logic for a specific command `C` and services `Services`, tied to a specific `State` type. Enables grouping related command logic while ensuring handlers are scoped to a single aggregate type. Uses manual async (`Pin<Box<dyn Future>>`) for explicit control.
* **Persistence (Planned):**
    * `EventSourcedRepository<AT>`: Trait (Port) defining `load` and `save` operations for `AggregateRoot<AT>` instances.
* **Dispatch & Middleware (Planned):**
    * A central dispatcher will route commands/queries.
    * Intends to use `tower::Service` for outer command/query handlers and `tower::Layer` for middleware (transactions, logging, metrics, validation, etc.).

## Usage (Placeholder)

```rust
// Usage examples will be added here once the core APIs stabilize.
// See the `examples/` directory in the repository (coming soon).

// Example structure (conceptual)
// 1. Define AggregateType, State, Event, Commands, Command Handlers
// 2. Implement AggregateState for State
// 3. Implement AggregateCommandHandler for logic handlers
// 4. Implement EventSourcedRepository for persistence
// 5. Configure Dispatcher and Middleware
// 6. Dispatch Commands / Queries
